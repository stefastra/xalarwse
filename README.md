Made just for fun. You need WatsonTcp from NuGet to modify the code, but it is included in the executable's folder.
(Work in progress, networking barely works as of now)

## Server
***NOTE: Not yet publicly available.***
**Defaults: IP: 0.0.0.0 (accessible via your external IPV4 address or your local IPV4 address) Port: 8910**
*You must forward the port to your computer's LAN network IP from your router settings.*

## To-Do
- Make it actually work as a group chat
